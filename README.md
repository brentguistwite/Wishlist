# Wishlist
### Yelp can cause decision paralysis!
- Recommendations from friends are great and often come up organically in our day-to-day lives, but are then easy to forget.
- Wishlist helps users keep track of the restaurants they want to go to rather than just frequenting the same old favorites week in and week out.
- Easily share with friends and family who are coming to visit to see your restaurant wishlist for that city.
